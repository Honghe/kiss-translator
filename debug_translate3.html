 <p>once I had coroutines, promises became real. <code>.then()</code> chaining worked. <code>await</code> actually paused execution and resumed later. the async side of the runtime started coming together. I started adding proper promise handling, and all the Promise builtins all came after this, and they came fast because the hard part was solved.</p>
