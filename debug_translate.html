            is still in an experimental state in the Wasm ecosystem, you will
            likely not pass structs with Wasm. Anything more complicated than
            scalars will require pointers and copying data in and out of Wasm
            linear memory. This involves the usual trap that catches nearly
            everyone: Wasm interfaces make no distinction between pointers and
            integers, and Wasm runtimes interpret generally interpret all
            integers as signed. What that means is
            <strong>your pointers are signed unless you take action</strong>.
            Addresses start at 0, so this is bad, bad news.
